## Web 3.0 real time strategy in the real historical setting
Zones of Conflict reflect the overall tendency of the web 3.0 gaming to build relatively fun and simple gameplay including play&earn options.

## Why not "play to earn" but "play&earn"?
Because we strongly believe that games are done to be fun first and the option to take something material/tangible away from it comes second. We see the difficulties of current big play to earn games (like Axie Infinity) and try to avoid them by implementing newly developed various details of gameplay and tokenomics.
The game is built on top of currently centralised service of Google Maps and allows players to pick a side in the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. Player can pick either Ukranian or Russian side to defend/attack the spot of land on the real worldmap. 

Each battle includes at least 2 players and lasts until one of them reaches one of the victory conditions (domination/annihilation/cease fire/alliance). Before and after each battle you go to your faction HQ

At the start of your commander's level the game takes place near one small settlement spot and allows to operate up to 5 military units only (which is a usual leitenant task). Then game after game your commander gains experience and in order to control bigger armies is able to qualify for the next military rank (sergeant-->leitenant-->captain-->major-->colonel-->general) after the education process in their faction HQ.

Your commander could be once evolved to the colonel and even general tier to oversee bigger battles, generate battle plans for the junior army officers what takes your game to a different mode where you become responsible for strategic land fights where multiple battles happen simultaneously.
